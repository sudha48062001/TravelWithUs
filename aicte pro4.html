            <p> Chandramouleshwar is estimated to be a 900-year-old temple from the Badami Chalukyan era. Chalukyas
                built this temple in the 11th - 12th century. It was built on the lines of Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal
                temples. Fables say that the Chalukyans wanted to boast their architectural prowess and wealth to their
                enemies. To do so, the Chalukyans commissioned anonymous artisans to build this temple overnight. But,
                the artisans couldn't complete the work within a night and the temple structure remains incomplete.
                According to some folklore, the sculptor Jaknacharya and his son built this temple. It is a Monument of
                National importance and is designated as a Protected Monument under the Ancient Monuments and
                Archaeological Sites Act (1958) by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

                • Unlike other Shiva temples in the North Karnataka region, the garbhagriha of the Chandramouleshwar
                Temple has four doors in all the four directions. The pradakshina path has four entrances. The
                mukhyamandapa too has four entrances, altogether accounting for twelve doors in the temple.
                • One of the two lingams is the 'Chaturmukha Lingam', a four-faced Shiva lingam, is a unique feature of
                the temple.

            <p>The temple has unfinished architecture, yet the most marvelous and a spectacular architecture by the
                Chalukyas. The unfinished temple has many quarters that have left half way done yet a visual
                delight.<br>
                The temple is constructed in the Chalukyan era and is clearly inscribed in stones which belong to the
                12th century in the Unkal village. The temple is designed in black granites. It has alluring sculptures
                and appealing carving that attracts many art lovers to the temple.

            <p>

                Chandramouleshwara temple has two shiva lingas out of that one of them is the ‘Chaturmugha Linga’ which
                is the four faced Shiva linga, one of the features that make the temple stand out among the various Lord
                Shiva temples in the state.

                Another spectacular feature of the temple architecture is the dancing Lord Ganesh and the Jaladhara
                images on the walls of the temple. Devotees come to worship Lord Shiva here. Mondays being a special day
                dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple receives numerous devotees who offer milk, curd, and sweets to the
                Lord to seek blessings.<br>
                The sthapathi or the sculptor of the temple could not finish the temple before the day-break, hence the
                temple was left half done. The wall height is around 20-25 feet out of which half of the temple is made
                of red stones while the other half is made of green stone, giving the temple an overall remarkable look.
                The temple is located on a raised place. The chancel of the temple contains four-faced Shiva linga.
                Unlike any other Lord Shiva temple, the temple has four doors in all the possible directions and a total
                of 12 doors.</p>

                <p> here is an urgent need of conservation and restoration of the Chandramouleshwar temple at Unkal<br>
                    The temple premises serve as a playground for children and youngsters to play cricket. It has become a
                    victim of government apathy and urbanization. There is virtually no approach road to the temple. The
                    encroachments on all the four sides of the temple make it difficult to access by vehicle. The roads
                    leading to the temple are very small with arrack shops and other illegal trades. One has to cross rows
                    of houses and narrow lanes to reach Chandramouleshwar temple.
                </p>
                <p>Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had begun work on the temple premises very long back. It started
                    work on a compound wall to prevent further encroachments, but this work too remains incomplete.

        <p>1)

            Can easily be the most under rated unknown monument in the densly populous unkal grama of Hubli which
            not even hubliates know. With zero marketing, zero maintenance, no facility, no signage lies a 12
            century western chalukya stone carved temple. This ancient temple needs lot of support and maintenance
            from govt to uplift and infuse tourism ( currently a mere wedding photoshoot spot) . Definitely a must
            visit to the claimed swayambhu linga being still worshipped.

        <p>2)this place is walkable distance from hubli dharwad highway. this place host shivaling which is pretty
            ancient. it was quite peaceful , probably because i visited the place during weekdays in the early
            morning. i had the whole place for myself and it was easy for me to explore the place and absorb all the
            history it holds within. overall i would highly recommend this place.</p>

        <p>3) have visited this place in January 2019 on my first visit to Hubli Dharwad, the temple of Lord Shiva
            it isn't active but still people worship Dev and pay their tribute to Lord Shiva.

            In terms of architecture I hadn't seen such a great art. If you are architecture lover then it is the
            best place and most visited for you.

            4) Chandramouleshwara Temple is very old temple and must visit place in Hubli. It is small temple but
            with
            good architecture. It is near to Unkal lake.<br><br>

            5) Nice visiting in the evening of first day journey a Chandramouleshwara Temple. Amazing example of
            ancient temple. However locals are not so keen about maintaining this heritage, approach road is very
            dirty and dosen't meet to standards of hubli road. Locals surrounding have encroached temple area. Great
            peaceful place spend good time.<br><br>
