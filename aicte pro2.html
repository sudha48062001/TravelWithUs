            <p>In May 1997, Bangalore ISKCON Temple was inaugurated by the ninth president of India—Shankar Dayal
                Sharma. Since 1999 it is under control of ISKCON Revival Movement.ISKCON Bangalore provides free food to
                those in need. The Akshaya Patra Foundation is one initiative
                started by members of the temple, which has received praise from United States President Barack Obama
                for feeding and educating children across India. A TV documentary has also been made on Akshaya Patra
                Foundation
                The Akshaya Patra Foundation is principally involved in implementing the Mid-Day Meal programme to the
                children in Government and Government-aided schools across India. It follows a Public-Private
                Partnership model of operation, and hence has been working in partnership with the Central and State
                Governments.
                It was set up in the year 2000 and runs the world's largest NGO-run Mid-Day Meal Programme. Akshaya
                Patra is currently operating in 27 locations across 11 states of India. It is reaching out to over
                13,500 Government and Government-aided schools feeding 1.6 million children every day.

                        <p>The name "Krishna" originates from the Sanskrit word Kṛṣṇa, which is primarily an adjective
                            meaning "black", "dark", "dark blue" or “the all attractive”.[31] The waning moon is called
                            Krishna Paksha, relating to the adjective meaning "darkening". The name is also interpreted

            <p> skcon is famous because the members, inspired and guided by Srila Prabhupada’s example have worked
                bloody
                hard to make it famous.
                <br>
                They tend to stand out, especially in countries outside India, with their shaved heads, dhotis or saris,
                particularly when chanting and dancing in crowded streets. But it’s more because there are core members
                who
                work very hard to spread awareness of Krishna. They will leave no stone unturned in this endeavour.
                <br><br>
                Purity is the force.
                <br>
                The Founder Acharya Srila A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is a pure devotee of the Lord. He
                established the prema nama sankirtan movement of Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu , ISKCON, all over the
                globe.
                <br>
                ISKCON is famous because its an authorized movement by Krishna and Krishna's Acharya parampara.
                <br><br>
                ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) is famous around the world because it has
                spread around the world and has Temples in nearly ‘every town and village’.
<br>
                The practice of prachaar (preaching) is performed by chanting the Hare Krishna kirtan up and down major
                streets of the world and distributing books. Most people are familiar with this public face of ISKCON.
