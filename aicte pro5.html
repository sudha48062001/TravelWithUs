            <p>The construction of Navagraha Teertha began in January 2005 and the carving of the monolithic statues was
                completed in one year. The work was supervised by Sri Gunadhar Nandi Maharaja and supported by Sri
                Dharmasena Bhattaraka Swamiji and volunteers.<br>
                Navagraha Teertha, which is located at Varur, a village just 29 km (18 mi) from Hubli-Dharwad city, has
                become an important place on the tourism map of the state, drawing huge crowds from all over the
                country. Navagraha Teertha, which is spread over 45 acres adjacent to the Pune-Bangalore Road, was set
                up by the Jain community with the help of people from other communities. It has been established largely
                through the efforts of Shri Gunadhar Nandi Maharaj.<br>
                It houses the 61 feet (19 m), 185-tonne monolithic statue of Shri Parshvanatha Teerthankar in the
                Kayotsarga posture mounted on a 48 feet (15 m) pedestal making its total height 109 feet (33 m). The
                construction of Navagraha Teertha began in January 2005 and the carving of the monolithic statues was
                completed in one year. The work was supervised by Sri Gunadhar Nandi Maharaj and supported by Sri
                Dharmasena Bhattaraka Swamiji and volunteers.<br>

            <h1 class="GS-xxxlarge GS-text-red"><b>Heritage</b></h1>


            <p>It is believed that the Graha doshas of nine planets can be resolved by worshipping the following nine
                Tirthankaras here. Accordingly, the statues have been mounted on respective planet-like structures that
                the Teerthankars represent at the Navagraha Tirtha. Bhagavan Padmaprabhu (Sun), Bhagavan Chandraprabhu
                (Moon), Vasupujya (Mars), Mallinath (Mercury), Mahaveer (Jupiter), Pushpadanta (Venus), Munisruvata
                (Saturn), and Neminatha (Rahu) have been installed. Bhagavan Parshwanath Teerthankar is believed to have
                the power to remove the dosha caused by Ketu.
                It is believed that the Graha doshas of nine planets can be conciliated by worshipping following nine
                Tirthankaras.
                <br>
                <br>

                The monolithic statue of lord Parshwanth is not only very attractive but also larger than the statue of
                Gommateshwara statue in Shravanabelagola. The statues of the Tirthankaras in Navagraha Teertha can be
                seen even up to 4 km (2.5 mi) away on the national highway while exiting the tapovan flyover exit near
                Varur on the Pune-Bangalore Road. Being in the city limit of Hubli Dharwad it is easy to reach there
                from any point of the city
