            <p>The great saint and exponent of Advaita philosophy, Swamy Siddharoodha was born at Chalakapur Village,
                Bhalki Taluka of Bidar district in Karnataka state, India on 26-03-1836 (Shalivahan Shake 1758 Durmukhi
                Nam Samvatsara Chaitra Shuddha Navami Day) Saint's parents, father Sri Gurushantappa and Mother Smt Deva
                Mallamma named the sacred child as “Siddha”.

                Swamy Sri Siddharudha's spiritual mentor pujyasri Gajadanda Shivayogi named his disciple saint as Sri
                Siddharudha Bharati and blessed with initiation of Avadhootashram Diksha and guided the saint to
                initiate Shiva panchakshari mantra to his disciples to lead them towards the path of Self-Realization.

                Then, Swamy Siddharudha went round India, Nepal, Ceylon, Tibet (china) and visited all holy places. He
                enlightened the devotees wherever he went, against ignorance, superstition and blind belief and directed
                them to realize divinity in themselves. The Great Saint endowed with spiritual powers never performed
                miracles but miracles happened to alleviate the miseries of the disciples who come to him to receive his
                divine blessings.

                Finally, the Great Spiritual Saint arrived at Hubli (Karnataka state) during 1877 then he was only 41
                years old.
            </p>
            <p>His Divine Presence ever blesses the devotees through his Shivayoga Samadhi at the Sri Siddharudha Ashram
                built by his devotees in memory of the great saint.

                Holy Chanting of the Divine Mantra “Om Namah Shivaya” day and night at the Ashram is the constant
                spiritual vibration to save mankind from misery and suffering. The Great yogi suggested to his devotees
                to chant openly this divine Mantra in Common Prayers and also in indidual prayers.

                The great Indian freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi visited
                the great saint for guidance and received the blessings during the freedom movement. Not only that the
                Badoda Maharaja his Highness Sri Sayaji Gaikawad and president of India Sri Gyani zailsingh and acting
                president B.D. Jatti and the former Home MinisterSardar Bootasingh and the supreme court justice Sri
                Ranganath Mishraji and all India political leaders visited this famous Matha.
